This is a Machine Learning project which is based on estimating the house price based on some independent features. 
In this ML project we perform various steps like data gathering, data preprocessing, data visualizing and finally data analyzing.
I applied various regression models like Linear regression, Polynomial regression, Random Forest regressor and Decision Tree regressor.
I found that Random Forest regressor gives the best accuracy while compared to other regression models.
I also made a web app using flask framework. The implementation of flask framework in at the end of the .ipng file.
Make sure that you save the files in the same way I uploaded in my Github.
index.html and result.html should bu in a folder called templates and the house.jpg file should be in static folder.
